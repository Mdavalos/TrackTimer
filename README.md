# TrackTimer
Class project of a track timer iOS app

This timer uses core data to store information about an athlete pertaining to their name, gender, year, birthday, and team name

There are two types of timers
  1. Individual timer is used for one athlete
  2. Relay timer is used for relay events and must have four people of the same gender to use it
  * Both timers use your location to get the location of where you are running
  * Only in that selection view is your location used once at the start of the view so as not to drain the battery
  * You are able to override the location and put in any location you choose
  
You can then view all the times together or view times by athlete
